    <h1>Code club</h1>

    <p>We will be looking to setup code clubs for kids in the local area as soon as the COVID situation allows</p>
    <p>In the mean time I'll share a few projects I have been working on with my family</p>
    <h2>Here is a list of projects I have been working on with my son</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="get_coding.html" title ="My first web page";>Building a web page using the Get Coding book</a></li>

        <li>We have been building a lot of games using Scrath and will add the links soon</li>
    </ul>
