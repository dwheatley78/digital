  <h1>3 Pillars of Digital Transformation</h1>

  <div>
    <p>WHEATLEY.digital aim to support local businesses identify and deliver affordable, high impact digital transforamtions ... 
      but what do we mean by digital transformation?</p>

    <p>Digital Transformation is about redefining how you operate and deliver value to your customers. 
      Enabling better decision-making, game-changing efficiencies, or delivering a better customer experience.  
      We can classify these as either growth or operational drivers </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Growth Drivers</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Demand Generation and Search and Selection:  Building awareness and brand interest</li>
        <li>Customer Experience:  Companies now have the ability to constantly engage with the customer making Customer Experience increasingly important </li>
        <li>Customer Process: Introducing new and optimised products, services, channel and pricing models</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Operational drivers</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Process Efficiency</li>
        <li>Asset Utilisation </li>
        <li>Increased Agility</li>
        <li>New Business & Service Models</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>In contrast <b>digitization</b> is the process of converting all of those ink-on-paper records to digital computer files, 
      while, <b>digitalisation</b> is about using existing digital data to simplify how you work without changing how you do business</p>
    <p>The following model from BCG captures the growing stages of maturity for for each of the 3 digital transformation pillars.</p>



    <ul>
      <li><a href="#select_project">Outcomes</a> - What you hope to achieve and ensuring it aligns with your company strategy.</li>
      <li><a href="#service_design">Human</a>- The changing behaviour, expectations and needs of any stakeholder are crucial</li>
        <li><a href="#change_management">Technology</a>- Finally we can start to develop solutions</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="/images/bcg_model.png" alt="BCG ditigal transformation model" style="width: 75%; display: block; margin: auto;"/>
    <p>Real world examples of implimenting these projects can be found in the ideas section. Alternatively <a href="mailto:david@wheatley.digital">get in touch</a> 
      to discuss what WHEATLEY.digital can do for you.</p> 
  </p>

  <div id="select_project" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
    <img src="/images/design_thinking.png" alt="Service Design Thinking" style="height: 100px; float:left;"/>
    <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Selecting the Strategic Outcomes</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:3px;clear:both;">
      A good solution can only be developed if first we understand the problem that needs to be addressed.  Setting a design challenge which normally takes the form:</p>
    <p>How might we leverage digital technology to …………...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve our ability to suggest the perfect product to our customer</li>
      <li>Ensure we know when something will break before it does.</li>
      <li>Improve the customer experience when they want to place an order.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>With a design brief in place we can then start to better understand the underlying issues to be addressed.  Business canvases provide an 
      excellent tool to collectively develop a shared understanding.  Templates are available from <a href="https://www.designabetterbusiness.tools/">Build a Better Business</a></p>  
    <p>Two in particular we use are the persona mapping and value proposition canvas shown below.</p>
    <img src="/images/canvas.png" alt="Design thinking canvas" style="width: 50%;  display: block; margin: auto;"/>
    <br><br>
    <p>To starting the shape where your digital transformation can add value by alleviating issues and accentuating the strengths 
      which normally involves maximising minimising, transferring, combining, adapting or replacing some feature of an existing process.</p>


    <p>The final step in setting the desired strategic outcome is to clarify any constraints such as budgets, schedules or resources that need to be adhered to.</p>

    <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Managing the Human Aspect</h2>
    <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">      
      The design thinking approach to developing a strategy is a great way to engage your team and make them part of the process, 
      however we need to consider more than just engagement.  A successful implementation requires a 
      multidisciplinary approach as defined in the following diagram. 
    </p>
    <p>Even large organizations are struggling with a “digital skills gap” for smaller organizations it’s generally impossible.  
      Selecting a partner that can work with you to help define your strategy, orchestrate the project and grow the technical 
      and analytical capabilities can be a great way forward.

    <h3>Agile project management</h4>
    <p>Traditional project management struggles against to deliver where the requirements are necessarily more fluid.  
      Adopting an agile project management philosophy, splitting the project into smaller (max 4 weeks) sprits, can deliver the following benefits. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Refining the project objective:</b> As the project progresses new goals will come to light and development can adapted to deliver these evolving requirements </li>
        <li><b>Change is embraced: </b>With shorter planning cycles, it’s easy to accommodate and accept changes at any time during the project. </li>
        <li><b>Faster, high-quality delivery: </b>Breaking down the project into manageable units allows the team to focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration.</li>
        <li><b>Strong team interaction: </b>Frequent communication and face-to-face interactions enabling members to take responsibility and own parts of the project.</li>
        <li><b>Continuous improvement: </b>Agile projects encourage feedback from users and team members throughout the whole project, so lessons learned are used to improve future iterations.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>To be successful teamwork is key.  We recommend establishing a project charter where the expected values are clear to the whole team is a great place to start.</p>
      <img src="/images/scrum_values.png" alt="Scrum Values" style="width: 50%; display: block; margin: auto;"/>
      <br><br>
      <h3>Effective Change Management</h4>
      <p>As discussed earlier digital transformation is about redefining how you operate and deliver value to your customers.  
        To extract the full value of the transformation effective change management is therefore fundamental.  
        The Leavitt model looks at the interplay of four key elements (structure, task, people and technology) and provides a good 
        framework to structure the change management process. </p>
      <img src="/images/leavitt_model.jpg" alt="Leavitt model" style="width: 25%; display: block; margin: auto;"/>
      <br><br>
      <ul>
        <li>PEOPLE- Employees are the backbone of an organization and much within an organisation depends on how they work, their expertise, knowledge and skills. 
          Training and recruitment may be required to equip the team with skills and expertise.</li>
        <li>STRUCTURE - Defines the departments, hierarchies and levels of supervision in a company.  Digital transformation will automate or simplify some activities while new requirements may also emerge.  
            As a result, what departments are required, how they operate and interact will need to be reviewed.</li>
        <li>TASK - refer to activities performed by employees. New processes will have to be defined enabling employees to 
            adapt to and exploit the technology by changing the way of doing things. </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  
  <br>

  <div>
    <div id="change_management" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <img src="/images/change.jpeg" alt="Change Management" style="height: 100px; float: left;"/>
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Developing the Technology</h2>
      <p style="padding-top:3px; clear:both;">While, large consultancy and technology firms offer expensive and often-unmanageable solutions, 
        we focus on using open source libraries to develop exactly what you need that can scale and grow with your ambitions.  
        Allowing the flexibility to evolve with your evolving requirements.
      </p>
      <p>Using Python, one of the most popular programming languages with extensive machine learning capabilities, 
        ensures that what we build will remain supportable and avoid the cost of large-scale commercial applications.
      </p>
      <p>The 5 core technology components of a digital transformation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Structured Data Platform – The fuel for you digital transformation is good quality data.</li>
        <li>Analytics and Insight Capability– The real value form all the data comes when you are able to extract insight and make predictions.</li>
        <li>Building Customer Services – Creating web applications that enable you to offer new customer value or connect in a more personalised and engaging way.</li>
        <li>User engagement and marketing – It’s all well and good having brilliant new services but you need to have a way to make your customers aware and engaged.</li>
        <li>User experience experimentation. – A/B testing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the ideas section I have developed some real worked examples that address each of these points.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of talk about the power of cloud and what it can bring.  The benefits can be great eliminating the needs for capital expenditure, increased resilience and leveraging the services it provides, but it can be expensive.  
        The key is to understand the requirement, your existing infrastructure and only then make a decision of what is right for you.</p>
