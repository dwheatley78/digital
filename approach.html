  <h1>3 Pillars of Digital Transformation</h1>

  <div>
    

    <p>Digital transformation is about redefining how you operate and/or deliver value to your customers, as defined below:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Operational value - decision-making, game-changing efficiencies, greater agility or new business models</li>
        <li>Customer value - Building awareness and brand interest, improved customer intimacy ornew services</li>
      </ul>


    <p>In order to deliver the value we must have a clear outcome and think of creating a bionic organisation, combining the strength of people and technology.
       The approach we take is to ensure each of the 3 pillars are properly managed throughout the digital transformation programme.  
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Outcomes">Outcomes</a> - A clear understanding of what you hope to achieve and ensuring it aligns with your company strategy.</li>
      <li><a href="#Human">Human</a> - Managing the changing behaviour, expectations and needs of all stakeholder throughout the process is crucial</li>
        <li><a href="#Technology">Technology</a>- Picking the best technical solutions ensuring they are affordable, supportable and scalable to adapt to your evolving requirements</li>
    </ul>


  </div>
  
  <div id="Outcomes" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
    <img src="/images/design_thinking.png" alt="Service Design Thinking" style="height: 100px; float:left;"/>
    <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Selecting the Strategic Outcomes</h2>
    <p style="padding-top:3px;clear:both;">We can only start developing a solution once the problem to be addressed is understood.   
      Setting a design challenge is a great place to start:</p>
    <p>How might we leverage digital technology to …………...</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve our ability to suggest the perfect product to our customer</li>
      <li>Ensure we know when something will break before it does.</li>
      <li>Improve the customer experience when they want to place an order.</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Business canvases, such as those at <a href="https://www.designabetterbusiness.tools/">Build a Better Business</a> provide an 
      excellent to develop a collective understanding.</p>  
    <p>In particular we find persona mapping and value propositions (shown below) are fantastic tools to understand where you can add value.
      Alleviating pains and accentuating the positives that exist in your business or for your customers.</p>

  <div id="Human" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
    <img src="/images/human.jpg" alt="Human Aspects" style="height: 100px; float: left;"/>
    <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Managing the Human Aspect</h2>
    <p style="padding:3px;clear:both;">      
      Developing a strategy using the design thinking approach is a great way to start engaging your team, however  as shown in the diagram below, a successful digital transformation requires ultiple roles
       thoroughout. Selecting a partner that can work with you to help define your strategy, orchestrate the project and grow the technical and analytical skills can be a great way forward.

    <h3>Agile project management</h3>
    <p>Traditional project management struggles to deliver in this necessarily more fluid environment.  
      Adopting an agile project management philosophy, splitting the project into smaller (max 4 weeks) sprints, can deliver the following benefits. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Refining the project objective:</b> As the project progresses new goals will come to light and development can adapted to deliver these evolving requirements </li>
        <li><b>Change is embraced: </b>With shorter planning cycles, it’s easy to accommodate and accept changes at any time during the project. </li>
        <li><b>Faster, high-quality delivery: </b>Breaking down the project into manageable units allows the team to focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration.</li>
        <li><b>Strong team interaction: </b>Frequent communication and face-to-face interactions enabling members to take responsibility and own parts of the project.</li>
        <li><b>Continuous improvement: </b>Agile projects encourage feedback from users and team members throughout the whole project, so lessons learned are used to improve future iterations.</li>
      </ul>


      <p>To be successful teamwork is key.  We recommend establishing a project charter where the expected values are clear to the whole team.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Effective Change Management</h4>
      <p>A comprehensive change programme is required to secure the value being offered by technology.  
       The Leavitt change model provides, enables the interplay of technology with the structure, tasks and people within the organisation to be understood.  The key aspects are:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><b>People</b> - Much within an organisation depends on how the employees work, their expertise, knowledge and skills. 
          Training and recruitment may be required to equip to operate effectively with the new technology solutions.</li>
        <li><b>Structure</b> - Digital transformation will automate or simplify some activities while new requirements may also emerge.  
            As a result, what departments are required, how they operate and interact will need to be reviewed.</li>
        <li><b>Task </b>- Refers to activities performed by employees. New processes will have to be defined enabling employees to 
            adapt to and exploit the technology by changing their way of doing things. </li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  
  <br>

  <div>
    <div id="Technology" style="background-color: white; padding:8px; border:2px solid black;">
      <img src="/images/change.jpeg" alt="Change Management" style="height: 100px; float: left;"/>
      <h2 style="padding:0px; float:left;">Developing the Technology</h2>
      <p style="padding-top:3px; clear:both;">While, large consultancy and technology firms offer expensive and often-unmanageable solutions, 
        we focus on using open source libraries to develop exactly what you need that can scale and grow with your ambitions.  
        Allowing the flexibility to evolve with your evolving requirements.
      </p>
      <p>Using Python, one of the most popular programming languages with extensive machine learning capabilities, 
        ensures that what we build will remain supportable and avoid the cost of large-scale commercial applications.
      </p>
      <p>The 5 core technology components of a digital transformation are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Structured Data Platform</b> – The fuel for you digital transformation is good quality data.</li>
        <li><b>Analytics and Insight Capability</b> – The real value form all the data comes when you are able to extract insight and make predictions.</li>
        <li><b>Building Customer Services</b> – Creating web applications that enable you to offer new customer value or connect in a more personalised and engaging way.</li>
        <li><b>User engagement and marketing</b> – It’s all well and good having brilliant new services but you need to have a way to make your customers aware and engaged.</li>
        <li><b>User experience experimentation</b>. – A/B testing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>In the ideas section I have developed some real worked examples that address each of these points.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of talk about the power of cloud and what it can bring.  The benefits can be great eliminating the needs for capital expenditure, increased resilience and leveraging the services it provides, but it can be expensive.  
        The key is to understand the requirement, your existing infrastructure and only then make a decision of what is right for you.</p>
